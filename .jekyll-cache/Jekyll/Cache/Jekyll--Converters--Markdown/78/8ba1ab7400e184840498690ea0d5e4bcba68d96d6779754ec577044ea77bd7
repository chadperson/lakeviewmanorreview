I"œ<p>This page is a a review of a VRBO and AirBNB property called <b>Lake View Manor</b> in Eden Vermont.</p>

<p>We stayed there in October 2022. The home was not clean, had an unusable bedroom that reeked of mildew, and had rodents (we watched mice scurry through the living room). I documented these and other complaints and emailed the owner, but was met with little empathy, an abrasive response, and inadequate compensation.</p>

<p>For their part, VRBO does not consider vermin nor mold safety hazards and they refused to dock the listing. Also, it is imperative that if you have any complaints about a VRBO property, you must contact VRBO directly (not the host) in the first 24 hours of your stay. Otherwise, VRBO remits all funds to the host and cannot (will not) offer any monetary compensation for your troubles.</p>

<p>Following the non-amicable resolution with the host, my only recourse was to leave a review on the VRBO site. For the long record I am posting it here.</p>

<p>Below you can read the review in entirety, view photos that I could not attach to the review, read my full correspondence with the host detailing my original complaints, and see the resolution (a partial refund that didnâ€™t even cover the â€˜cleaningâ€™ fee).

<div style="">
We booked this house for a short trip with my extended family. Unfortunately, the property was in poor shape when we arrived. 
<br /><br />
The basement bedroom was unusable due to the musky mold smell. Cob webs, dust, and greasy surfaces were everywhere. And to add to this- there were mice in the main living area (which were apparently being mitigated). 
<br /><br />
The stay put a real damper on an otherwise great trip experience- which is a shame because we needed a larger property and paid a premium price for this house. 
<br /><br />
If you are looking to spend time outside, then house may be a good fit, but if you plan to be indoors, I hope it is renovated and/or deep cleaned and mold mitigated before you visit. 
<br /><br />
I documented everything we experienced with photos and sent them to the owner. I requested a fair partial refund (reimbursement of the cleaning fee and the amount of value for the unusable room) and he offered me $100. 
<br /><br />
Owner communication was civil up until he realized I was expecting a refund, then he accused me of lying about my complaints. If you want to read the entire correspondence and view photos, search Lakeview Manor Eden review with your favorite search engine for details.
<br /><br />
Apparently, the owner was more concerned about the investments he had made into the property then combating us in a clean, safe space.
<br /><br />
I suggest booking elsewhere when staying in the lovely state of Vermont. <br /><br />
