# Unclean. Has Mice and Mold. Property Not as Represented - One Bedroom Unusable. Otherwise nice spot.

We booked this house for a short trip with my extended family. Unfortunately, the property was in poor shape when we arrived. 

The basement bedroom was unusable due to the musky mold smell. Cob webs, dust, and greasy surfaces were everywhere. And to add to this- there were mice in the main living area (which were apparently being mitigated). 

The stay put a real damper on an otherwise great trip experience- which is a shame because we needed a larger property and paid a premium price for this house. 

If you are looking to spend time outside, then house may be a good fit, but if you plan to be indoors, I hope it is renovated and/or cleaned before your booking. 

I suggest booking elsewhere when staying in the lovely state of Vermont. 

I documented everything we experienced with photos and sent them to the owner. I requested a fair partial refund (reimbursement of the cleaning fee and the amount of value for the unusable room) and he offered me $100. 

Owner communication was civil up until he realized I was expecting a refund, then he accused me of lying about my complaints. If you want to read the entire correspondence and view photos, search Lakeview Manor Eden review with your favorite search engine for details.

Apparently, the owner was more concerned about the investments he had made into the property then combating us in a clean, safe space.
